# Privacy Policy for DailyGlance

**Last updated: December 29, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to DailyGlance. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Information We Collect

**DailyGlance does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.** The app is designed with privacy as a core principle.

- We do not collect analytics or usage data
- We do not track your location
- We do not require an account or login
- We do not collect device identifiers

## Local Data Storage

All data used by DailyGlance is stored locally on your device:

- **EPUB Content:** Scripture content from EPUB files you import is processed and stored entirely on your device
- **Widget Settings:** Your customization preferences (colors, fonts, styles) are stored locally using iOS App Groups to sync between the app and widgets
- **No Cloud Sync:** Your data is never uploaded to external servers

## In-App Purchases

DailyGlance offers optional tip jar purchases to support development. These transactions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information, and Apple's privacy policy governs these transactions.

## Third-Party Services

DailyGlance does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external service interaction is with Apple's App Store for optional tip jar purchases.

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect any data, there is no data retention. All app data remains on your device and can be removed by deleting the app.

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- **Access:** All your data is stored locally on your device
- **Deletion:** Uninstalling the app removes all associated data
- **Portability:** Your EPUB files remain yours and can be used in other applications

## Children's Privacy

DailyGlance does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age. The app contains no mechanisms for data collection.
